# Code Louisville Python/SQL project.

In this project, I will try to answer the following question:

## Does the Federal Reserve take into account the Stock Market when making decision on the Federal Funds Rate?

The Federal Reserve has repeatedly stated that it does not take into account stock prices when deliberating on rate action. I have obtained historical stock market data, GDP growth, and federal funds rate data and will attempt to establish if there is a relationship between the two. Obviously the two will have some correlation - market conditions may reflect economic conditions, and as such, we will used GDP growth as a control. GDP growth might be the best indicator of economic conditions at a glance, this project will attempt to discern if the relationship between the federal funds rate and the s&p 500 ever deviates from the relationship between the federal funds rate and GDP growth in the United States, going back to 1954.
